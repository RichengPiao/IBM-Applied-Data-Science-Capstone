# IBM - Applied Data Science Capstone
This is an applied data science capstone project repository for IBM data science specialization certification.

In this capstone, I will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if I can determine if the first stage will land, I can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
## Step 1-1:
Collect data and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. 
## Step 1-2:
Web scraping is performed to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page.
